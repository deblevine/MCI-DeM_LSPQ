**MCI DeM Aim 2, Study 3**

**Analytic Plan**

**Date created:** 11/01/19

**Date updated:** 12/10/19

**Aim 2. DETERMINE THE INFLUENCE OF MCI ON PATIENT AND STUDY PARTNER PREFERENCES AND PHYSICIAN RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AMI AND ISCHEMIC STROKE TREATMENT.**

We will conduct a multi-center, mixed methods study at the University of Michigan and Duke University using semi-structured interviews and surveys of MCI patients and study partners, as well as a national physician survey. We will explore patient, study partner and physician factors leading to treatment differences.

We will conduct a mailed survey of patients (50% MCI, 50% no MCI) and study partners (50% Black, 50% White in each group). Unexposed subjects from the qualitative study will be recruited. Patients with no MCI will be 1:1 matched to patients with MCI, by age, race and sex.

**Hypothesis:** MCI patients and study partners prefer less intensive treatment than patients with no MCI.

**STUDY SAMPLE**

| **Sample size** | **Patient** | **Partner** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **MCI** | **No MCI** | **MCI** | **No MCI** |
| Planned | 50(50% AA) | 50(50% AA) | 50(50% AA) | 50(50% AA) |
| Actual | _n_(%) | _n_(%) | _n_(%) | _n_(%) |
| AA=African American. |   |   |

**Participants:** Elderly patients and their study partners recruited from Duke and UM sites.

**Inclusion criteria (based on patient):**

- Has a diagnosis of MCI or no MCI (50% of sample in each group)
- Aged =65 years
- White (50% of sample) or Black (50% of sample)
- Received cognitive testing within the last 12 months
- Reads/speaks English
- Has a study partner =18 years of age who reads/speaks English, knows the patient well and can answer questions about them regarding medical treatment preferences

**Exclusion criteria (based on patient and study partner):**

- We will exclude participants with missing information on age, race or sex and those who do not meet the inclusion criteria outlined above.

**Study design:**

- Cross-sectional
- Sampling unit: Patient-study partner dyad
- Stratifying variables: study site (Duke vs UM), race (White vs Black), cognitive status (MCI vs no MCI)



**VARIABLES OF INTEREST**

**Dependent variables:**

- **Primary DV:** _Life-Support Preferences-Predictions Questionnaire (LSPQ) score_. 1 continuous variable with 24 items [CITATION Cop99 \m Cop01 \m Dit01 \l 1033]
- **Secondary DVs:**
  - _General preferences for shared decision making (SDM)_. 1 categorical variable with 5 items, assessed by Degner control preferences scale [CITATION Deg97 \l 1033]
    - One item with 5-point Likert scale. 1) I prefer to make the decision about which treatment I will receive. 2) I prefer to make the final decision about my treatment after seriously considering my doctor&#39;s opinion. 3) I prefer that my doctor and I share responsibility for deciding which treatment is best for me.4) I prefer that my doctor makes the final decision about which treatment will be used, but seriously considers my opinion.5) I prefer to leave all decisions regarding treatment to my doctor.
  - _Preferences for SDM in AMI and Acute Ischemic Stroke__._ 8 categorical variables with 5 items
    - 8 questions asking subjects about the degree to which they would want to be involved in making medical decisions if they had an AMI or ischemic stroke using 5-point Likert scale (definitely want, probably want, unsure, probably do not want, and definitely do not want to be involved).
      - 4 decisions after AMI (coronary angioplasty, bypass surgery, outpatient cardiac rehabilitation, and cholesterol medicine)
      - 4 decisions after ischemic stroke (t-PA, carotid surgery, inpatient stroke rehabilitation, and anticoagulation medicine)
  - _Risk Perception__._ 4 categorical variables with 5 items
    - 4questions asking subjects about their perceptions of 4 major health risks (fall, AMI, stroke and dementia) over the next 2 years using 5-point Likert scale (measures adapted from Weinstein et al. [CITATION Wei07 \n \t \l 1033]
- _Patient and study partners will complete the same survey but study partners will predict patients&#39; preferences for treatments (double check study partners were asked Degner about themselves and not patient). Analyses will be conducted for patients and study partners independently._

** Independent variables:**

- **Primary IV:** _Baseline MCI_ (clinical determination at each site; treated as binary)

- **Secondary IVs:**
  - **Demographic:** Age, sex, education, race, study site (Duke vs UM)
  - **Social support:** Marital status, any children, lives with child, child lives\&lt;30 miles away
  - **Health status:** self-reported health status, medical history (stroke, heart disease, lung disease, cancer and arthritis), depressive symptoms measured by PHQ-2, ADL limitations measured by 6-item scale from HRS, study partner-reported DSRS, patient MOCA score
  - **Experience with CVD and dementia:** contacts with: stroke, dementia, AMI
  - **Dyad characteristics:** Relationship to study partner, length of time known study partner, frequency of seeing study partner, frequency of talking to study partner
  - **Moderator:** race\*MCI

**ANALYTIC STEPS**

1. **Describe recruitment** (eligible subjects who agreed to participate) and compare characteristics between recruited and non-recruited patients using data from recruitment database.
2. **Quantify study completion** (recruited subjects who completed study) and compare characteristics between completers and non-completers using data from recruitment database.
3. **Generate dataset** , ensuring that data is organized in the appropriate format (e.g., long vs wide).
4. **Check data quality** by examining univariate distribution of predictors and outcomes. Deal with small cells, missing data, outliers, skewness and kurtosis as appropriate. Alter analytic plan as appropriate based on linearity and homoscedasticity of associations.
5. **Perform preliminary analyses** and generate a participant characteristics table. Analyses will include basic descriptive statistics and bivariate comparisons of characteristics by the grouping variable.

\*MCI status is in reference to the patient associated with each study partner.

_[Also include: depressed mood. ADL limitations, self-reported health status, medical history, study partner reported DSRS.] [Table 2A. Dyad characteristics.]_

1. **Perform missing data analyses** as appropriate.

1.
  - Example approach by Davey &amp; Dai [CITATION Dav19 \n \t \l 1033]._[Note: this approach was developed to guide the process of multiple imputation (MI). An assumption of MI is that the &quot;missingness mechanism&quot; has been explored. There are many patterns to consider in a multivariate context.]_

S1: Create dichotomous indicators for all variables with missing data

S2: Perform a principal component analysis on missing data indicators

S3: Determine the number of components (_k_) to retain using parallel analysis

S4: Extract components and calculate predicted component scores

S5: Dichotomize component scores (examine distribution or split at 0)

S6: Examine observed variables/missing data indicators by component score

S7: Predict dichotomized component scores from observed variables and/or missing data indicators (using logistic regression or similar method)

S8: Examine cross-tabs by dichotomized component scores if pattern unclear

S9: Consider examining cross-tabs by a stratifying variable if pattern still unclear

S10: Examine patterns by known characteristics of study design

Next steps: Repeat process using _k_-1 and _k_+1 and perform MI as appropriate.

1. **Perform statistical analyses**
  - Select the appropriate statistical methods, keeping in mind: Study aims, sample sizes and characteristics of IVs and DVs of interest (e.g., variable types, normality and variance). Primary, secondary and sensitivity analyses:
    - **Treatment preferences**
      - **Primary 1:** MCI status predicting patient summary LSPQ. Statistical method: linear regression. Covariates: patient and partner characteristics.
      - **Secondary 1:** MCI status predicting study partner summary LSPQ. Statistical method: linear regression. Covariates: patient and partner characteristics.
      - **Secondary 2:** Concordance within patient-partner dyads, quantified by intra-class correlation coefficients adjusted for dyad characteristics. Statistical method: linear mixed effects models. Covariates: dyad characteristics assessed.
      - **Sensitivity:** [Indicate sensitivity analyses that need to be performed.]
    - **Preferences for SDM**
      - **Secondary 1:** MCI status predicting patient agreement with Degner control preferences scale. Statistical method: Kruskal-Wallis. Covariates: patient and partner characteristics.
      - **Secondary 2:** MCI status predicting study partner agreement with Degner control preferences scale. Statistical method: Kruskal-Wallis. Covariates: patient and partner characteristics.
      - **Sensitivity:** [Indicate sensitivity analyses that need to be performed.]
    - **Preferences for SDM in AMI and Acute Ischemic Stroke**
      - **Secondary 1:** MCI status predicting patient willingness to be involved in SDM after an AMI (4 decisions proposed) and acute ischemic stroke (4 decisions proposed). Statistical method: Kruskal-Wallis. Covariates: patient and partner characteristics.
      - **Secondary 2:** MCI status predicting study partner willingness to be involved in making medical decisions after an AMI (4 decisions proposed) and acute ischemic stroke (4 decisions proposed). Statistical method: Kruskal-Wallis. Covariates: patient and partner characteristics.
      - **Sensitivity:** Sums of decisions proposed for AMI (4) and stroke (4) examined.
    - **Risk perception**
      - **Secondary 1:** MCI status predicting patient perceptions of 4 major health risks (fall, stroke, AMI, dementia) in the next 2 years based on measures adapted from Weinstein et al. [CITATION Wei071 \n \t \l 1033]. Statistical method: Kruskal-Wallis. Covariates: patient and partner characteristics.
      - **Secondary 2:** MCI status predicting study partner perceptions of patient&#39;s 4 major health risks (fall, stroke, AMI, dementia) in the next 2 years based on measures adapted from Weinstein et al. [CITATION Wei071 \n \t \l 1033]. Statistical method: Kruskal-Wallis. Covariates: patient and partner characteristics.
      - **Sensitivity:** [Indicate sensitivity analyses that need to be performed.]
  - Perform primary, secondary and sensitivity analyses using the models specified. Examine diagnostic measures for each analysis performed. Models:
    - **M1 Zero order:** DV = patient MCI
    - **M2 Demographic:** DV = M1 + site + partner age + partner sex + partner education + partner race + patient age + patient sex + patient education + patient race
    - **M3 Social support:** M2 + partner marital status + patient marital status + patient children + patient lives with child + patient child \&lt;30 miles away
    - **M4 Health status:** DV = M3 + partner depressed mood + patient depressed mood + partner ADL limitations + patient ADL limitations + partner-assessed patient DSRS + partner health status + patient health status + partner medical history + patient medical history + partner MoCA score + patient MoCA score (check for co-linearity between DSRS and ADL limitations)
    - **M5 Experience:** M4 + partner contacts with stroke + patient contacts with stroke + partner contacts with dementia + patient contacts with dementia + partner contacts with AMI + patient contacts with AMI
    - **M6 Dyad characteristics:** M5 + patient relationshipto study partner + length of time known study partner + frequency of seeing study partner + frequency of talking to study partner (check for co-linearity between frequency of seeing and talking to study partner)
      - Notes: 1. Multicolinearity will be examined and stepwise procedures will be used to reduce the number of covariates per model. Underlined covariates will be forced into models (patient demographics will be forced into models for patient analyses and partner demographics will be forced into models for partner analyses); 2. Race\*MCI will be examined as an addition to each model.
2. **Table and interpret results** as appropriate. Label all code and analytic datasets using unique identifiers and store them in a secure location (e.g., GitHub) following our new protocol.
