# MCI-DeM_LSPQ

This repository contains files pertaining to the Levine et al. project entitled "The Association between Mild Cognitive Impairment Diagnosis and Patient Treatment Preferences: A Survey of Older Adults."


## MCI DeM Objectives

1. Determine the extent to which patients with mild cognitive impairment receive sub-standard cardiovascular disease care, increasing the risk of morbidity and mortality in a population with otherwise good quality of life. 

2. Determine how mild cognitive impairment influences patient-partner preferences (Aim 2, Study 3) and physician recommendations (Aim 2, Study 4) for acute myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke treatment.
